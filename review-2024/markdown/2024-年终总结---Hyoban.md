## 2024 Year-End Summary

## Graduation[#](#user-content-graduation)

In the first half of this year, I finally graduated from the school I attended for seven years. This is a relief for me.

> How do I evaluate the significance of my graduate school experience?

On one hand, I changed the most during my graduate phase. I found what I truly enjoy doing and formed my own worldview. I learned front-end development, participated in open source, worked remotely, looked for jobs, and almost every period left behind traces worth recording. If you're interested in these, you can read these two articles.

On the other hand, for someone like me who is not good at or fond of research, these were also the days when I encountered the most troubles. The matters related to school and mentors were hard to spark my interest, and the overall environment was difficult to relate to freedom. In the end, three years resulted in a patchwork thesis and a pass that lowered the difficulty of entering society. However, I was fortunate to meet some great classmates who brought me a lot of comfort.

## Work[#](#user-content-work)

After graduation, I worked at Meituan for two months.

> How was the work experience at Meituan?

To be honest, the overall work at Meituan was quite good. I could basically leave work around seven or eight every day, and the tasks weren't too complicated. My colleagues and leaders in the team were also very nice. If I didn't have a more ideal and free job, working here temporarily would be fine. But after all, this job felt more like a cog in the machine, and living in rented accommodation in Beijing was not what I wanted.

> Why was I able to decisively choose to leave the internet?

From many people's perspective, quitting a "stable" job at an internet company early after graduation doesn't seem like a prudent choice, but I could make this decision without any hesitation. Because my long-held ideal has always been to obtain a remote open-source job, doing what I love and living freely. As a saying I like goes, Don’t do what you should do, do what you want. (This was said by Russ Hanneman in the TV series Silicon Valley; although he is unreliable, this statement is still very true.)

---

Starting in September, I joined RSS3 and successfully transitioned to a full-time position three months later.

> How did I find such an ideal and free job?

It's actually quite simple; I just kept doing what I loved.

-   My contributions to xLog and RSSHub, projects I really liked and had been using, led me to meet DIYgod.
-   I saw the new Follow project that DIYgod started this year, which matched my vision of an RSS reader, so I got involved in the project early.
-   My participation in the Follow project led to an invitation to officially join the team as a full-time developer.

The starting point for doing these things was that I really enjoyed them, without considering what they could bring me. If I hadn't obtained a full-time job at Follow, I would still participate in my spare time; this is something I would willingly do even without payment. From my experience, this way, you can more easily feel happiness and fulfillment, achieving an outcome you like. It's like playing a game without deliberately grinding tasks or following guides to pursue perfection.

> How is the work at RSS3?

After joining RSS3, my feeling is that I've come to a place where I can stay for at least 10 years; I currently can't find any drawbacks, and this is the most suitable job for me.

-   In the Follow project, no one assigns you tasks; you find things to do driven by your interests, and the products are open source.
-   The team atmosphere is very friendly, and I feel I can become good friends with any member of the team.
-   Completely remote work with no fixed hours allows for a good balance between work and life.
-   The salary and benefits are uncompromised, so I don't have to worry about the hardships of living. (This is the least important.)

## Open Source[#](#user-content-open-source)

This year, I started a monthly sponsorship plan for open source, with a budget of $20 per month.

> Who did I sponsor? How much did I spend in total?

You can see who or what projects I have sponsored on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hyoban?tab=sponsoring), [open collective](https://opencollective.com/hyoban), and [爱发电](https://afdian.com/a/hyoban) homepage. Most of them are projects I use and authors of blogs I read.

The specific sponsorship amounts are as follows, totaling about $253.35, averaging about $21.11 per month.

-   GitHub $168.06
-   open collective 47.58 sgd
-   爱发电 270 cny

> How do I sponsor? Why do I sponsor the community monthly?

At first, I chose to sponsor certain people on a monthly basis long-term, along with Anthony Fu's [sponsorship forwarding plan](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding). However, I later found that this limited the open-source authors I could support within my budget, so I opted to manually sponsor once at a time, contributing $5 each time.

I use many open-source authors' projects daily, but the work of many of these individuals may be overlooked, and their efforts do not receive corresponding rewards. I believe that continuing this way is detrimental to the development of the open-source community, so I want to do my part for it.

This year, I also received some sponsorships from others, and I am very grateful to [cuikaipeng](https://github.com/cuikaipeng), [Hakadao](https://afdian.com/a/Hakadao), and [emiyaaaaa](https://afdian.com/a/emiyaaaaa) for their support; I will consider this money as part of my sponsorship budget for next year.

---

This year, I successfully got a small project of mine used by others and made some contributions to Follow.

> Are there any projects I want to share?

-   [tailwindcss-classname-highlight](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwindcss-classname-highlight) highlights the class names in your code files that will correctly generate to CSS, and this year it supports tailwind v4 beta. I also extracted the part that interacts with the tailwind API and released [tailwind-api-utils](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwind-api-utils).
-   [eslint-config-hyoban](https://github.com/hyoban/eslint-config-hyoban) is an ESLint preset that I think is quite good, mainly containing plugins and rules related to React and TypeScript. If you're using it and have rules or plugins you'd like to configure, feel free to open an issue for me to add them.

You can find more projects on my [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/hyoban).

> What open-source projects am I currently focusing on?

Since my full-time open-source job is working on Follow, most of my time is spent on development related to Follow. Sometimes I also submit PRs to upstream projects based on needs and issues encountered during development. For example, I recently worked on some auth-related features and fixed a few bugs in [better-auth](https://better-auth.com); overall, it is a very useful auth-related library with rich integrations.

## Life[#](#user-content-life)

After leaving Beijing, I started a life of traveling in different cities. This year, I went to Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Changsha, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.

> How do I travel and balance work and life?

The overall rhythm this year is to change cities every week or two, mostly choosing places where I have classmates or friends. I stay fixed in one city from Monday to Friday, finding a stable place to work. Since I have classmates in the area, I can often crash at their place. On weekends, I take a flight or train to the next city, possibly wandering around randomly or meeting friends for a meal.

This sounds more like constantly changing places to work. I’m not someone who enjoys checking in at tourist spots, and if my week is filled with work and play, I won't have enough energy. So, the traveling life in the second half of the year was divided into two parts: in October, I stayed home to avoid the National Day rush, and after finishing my trip to Guangzhou, I returned home to rest.

Next year, I plan to extend my stay in different places to at least a month, reducing my travel fatigue and giving me more time to experience each city.

> Is there anything worth mentioning?

Thanks to working at Follow, I recorded an episode of [web worker](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67489d8c0ed328720a0ed3ca) with team members. Since it’s a show I’ve always enjoyed listening to, I felt excited to have the opportunity to appear on it.

Although I haven't become a very proactive or outgoing person yet, this year I also met some friends I had previously interacted with online, gradually overcoming the issue of not being able to thrive in unfamiliar environments. I am very grateful to the friends who were willing to interact and have fun with me ([situ](https://x.com/situ200l), [cosine](https://x.com/_cosine_x), [雪谋](https://x.com/YukiHakarigoto), [Hakadao](https://x.com/Hakadaooo), [qiuqiu](https://x.com/0xqiuqiuu)). New friends are also welcome to connect with me; I am very open to meeting new people, and we can grab a meal or hang out together.

---

This year, I gradually started buying some digital equipment I hadn't purchased before.

> What notable items did I buy? What do I plan to buy next?

-   nuphy air 60 v2: My first time using a low-profile keyboard, and with its size and weight, it has become a great companion for my Mac while traveling.
-   AirPods 4th generation: My first wireless noise-canceling headphones; I found they play a crucial role in many scenarios during my travels.
-   PS5: My first gaming console; I will start playing Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2024, and I welcome everyone to recommend games to me.

I also want to buy a NAS, but the recommendations are varied, and I'm a bit unsure about which model to choose. Next year, I plan to get a new computer; my current M1 Pro is a bit insufficient, mainly because it only has 16GB of memory.

## Emotions[#](#user-content-emotions)

This year was also another year of being single; I welcome everyone to introduce me to potential partners. However, I feel it will be quite difficult for me to find someone because I am short (less than 1.7 meters) and not very good-looking.

I used to hope that I wouldn't gradually become distant from previous friends due to a lack of daily interaction, but I am now gradually accepting this fact.

## Summary[#](#user-content-summary)

Alright, this is my year-end summary for 2024. For me, 2024 was a year of realizing dreams and the beginning of a new journey. I hope that in the days to come, I can continue to be a free and interesting person, doing what I love while planning for my future.

As you can see, there are no pictures in this summary because I haven't developed the habit of taking photos worth storing. I hope to cultivate the habit of recording life next year, making next year's summary more colorful.

This is a relief for me.\\n\\n\\u003e How do I evaluate the significance of my graduate school experience?\\n\\nOn one hand, I changed the most during my graduate phase. I found what I truly enjoy doing and formed my own worldview. I learned front-end development, participated in open source, worked remotely, looked for jobs, and almost every period left behind traces worth recording. If you're interested in these, you can read these two articles.\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/work-one-year\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/24-years\\n\\nOn the other hand, for someone like me who is not good at or fond of research, these were also the days when I encountered the most troubles. The matters related to school and mentors were hard to spark my interest, and the overall environment was difficult to relate to freedom. In the end, three years resulted in a patchwork thesis and a pass that lowered the difficulty of entering society. However, I was fortunate to meet some great classmates who brought me a lot of comfort.\\n\\n## Work\\n\\nAfter graduation, I worked at Meituan for two months.\\n\\n\\u003e How was the work experience at Meituan?\\n\\nTo be honest, the overall work at Meituan was quite good. I could basically leave work around seven or eight every day, and the tasks weren't too complicated. My colleagues and leaders in the team were also very nice. If I didn't have a more ideal and free job, working here temporarily would be fine. But after all, this job felt more like a cog in the machine, and living in rented accommodation in Beijing was not what I wanted.\\n\\n\\u003e Why was I able to decisively choose to leave the internet?\\n\\nFrom many people's perspective, quitting a \\"stable\\" job at an internet company early after graduation doesn't seem like a prudent choice, but I could make this decision without any hesitation. Because my long-held ideal has always been to obtain a remote open-source job, doing what I love and living freely. As a saying I like goes, Don’t do what you should do, do what you want. (This was said by Russ Hanneman in the TV series Silicon Valley; although he is unreliable, this statement is still very true.)\\n\\n---\\n\\nStarting in September, I joined RSS3 and successfully transitioned to a full-time position three months later.\\n\\n\\u003e How did I find such an ideal and free job?\\n\\nIt's actually quite simple; I just kept doing what I loved.\\n\\n- My contributions to xLog and RSSHub, projects I really liked and had been using, led me to meet DIYgod.\\n- I saw the new Follow project that DIYgod started this year, which matched my vision of an RSS reader, so I got involved in the project early.\\n- My participation in the Follow project led to an invitation to officially join the team as a full-time developer.\\n\\nThe starting point for doing these things was that I really enjoyed them, without considering what they could bring me. If I hadn't obtained a full-time job at Follow, I would still participate in my spare time; this is something I would willingly do even without payment. From my experience, this way, you can more easily feel happiness and fulfillment, achieving an outcome you like. It's like playing a game without deliberately grinding tasks or following guides to pursue perfection.\\n\\n\\u003e How is the work at RSS3?\\n\\nAfter joining RSS3, my feeling is that I've come to a place where I can stay for at least 10 years; I currently can't find any drawbacks, and this is the most suitable job for me.\\n\\n- In the Follow project, no one assigns you tasks; you find things to do driven by your interests, and the products are open source.\\n- The team atmosphere is very friendly, and I feel I can become good friends with any member of the team.\\n- Completely remote work with no fixed hours allows for a good balance between work and life.\\n- The salary and benefits are uncompromised, so I don't have to worry about the hardships of living. (This is the least important.)\\n\\n## Open Source\\n\\nThis year, I started a monthly sponsorship plan for open source, with a budget of $20 per month.\\n\\n\\u003e Who did I sponsor? How much did I spend in total?\\n\\nYou can see who or what projects I have sponsored on my \[GitHub\](https://github.com/hyoban?tab=sponsoring), \[open collective\](https://opencollective.com/hyoban), and \[爱发电\](https://afdian.com/a/hyoban) homepage. Most of them are projects I use and authors of blogs I read.\\n\\nThe specific sponsorship amounts are as follows, totaling about $253.35, averaging about $21.11 per month.\\n\\n- GitHub $168.06\\n- open collective 47.58 sgd\\n- 爱发电 270 cny\\n\\n\\u003e How do I sponsor? Why do I sponsor the community monthly?\\n\\nAt first, I chose to sponsor certain people on a monthly basis long-term, along with Anthony Fu's \[sponsorship forwarding plan\](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding). However, I later found that this limited the open-source authors I could support within my budget, so I opted to manually sponsor once at a time, contributing $5 each time.\\n\\nI use many open-source authors' projects daily, but the work of many of these individuals may be overlooked, and their efforts do not receive corresponding rewards. I believe that continuing this way is detrimental to the development of the open-source community, so I want to do my part for it.\\n\\nThis year, I also received some sponsorships from others, and I am very grateful to \[cuikaipeng\](https://github.com/cuikaipeng), \[Hakadao\](https://afdian.com/a/Hakadao), and \[emiyaaaaa\](https://afdian.com/a/emiyaaaaa) for their support; I will consider this money as part of my sponsorship budget for next year.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis year, I successfully got a small project of mine used by others and made some contributions to Follow.\\n\\n\\u003e Are there any projects I want to share?\\n\\n- \[tailwindcss-classname-highlight\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwindcss-classname-highlight) highlights the class names in your code files that will correctly generate to CSS, and this year it supports tailwind v4 beta. I also extracted the part that interacts with the tailwind API and released \[tailwind-api-utils\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwind-api-utils).\\n- \[eslint-config-hyoban\](https://github.com/hyoban/eslint-config-hyoban) is an ESLint preset that I think is quite good, mainly containing plugins and rules related to React and TypeScript. If you're using it and have rules or plugins you'd like to configure, feel free to open an issue for me to add them.\\n\\nYou can find more projects on my \[GitHub homepage\](https://github.com/hyoban).\\n\\n\\u003e What open-source projects am I currently focusing on?\\n\\nSince my full-time open-source job is working on Follow, most of my time is spent on development related to Follow. Sometimes I also submit PRs to upstream projects based on needs and issues encountered during development. For example, I recently worked on some auth-related features and fixed a few bugs in \[better-auth\](https://better-auth.com); overall, it is a very useful auth-related library with rich integrations.\\n\\n## Life\\n\\nAfter leaving Beijing, I started a life of traveling in different cities. This year, I went to Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Changsha, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.\\n\\n\\u003e How do I travel and balance work and life?\\n\\nThe overall rhythm this year is to change cities every week or two, mostly choosing places where I have classmates or friends. I stay fixed in one city from Monday to Friday, finding a stable place to work. Since I have classmates in the area, I can often crash at their place. On weekends, I take a flight or train to the next city, possibly wandering around randomly or meeting friends for a meal.\\n\\nThis sounds more like constantly changing places to work. I’m not someone who enjoys checking in at tourist spots, and if my week is filled with work and play, I won't have enough energy. So, the traveling life in the second half of the year was divided into two parts: in October, I stayed home to avoid the National Day rush, and after finishing my trip to Guangzhou, I returned home to rest.\\n\\nNext year, I plan to extend my stay in different places to at least a month, reducing my travel fatigue and giving me more time to experience each city.\\n\\n\\u003e Is there anything worth mentioning?\\n\\nThanks to working at Follow, I recorded an episode of \[web worker\](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67489d8c0ed328720a0ed3ca) with team members. Since it’s a show I’ve always enjoyed listening to, I felt excited to have the opportunity to appear on it.\\n\\nAlthough I haven't become a very proactive or outgoing person yet, this year I also met some friends I had previously interacted with online, gradually overcoming the issue of not being able to thrive in unfamiliar environments. I am very grateful to the friends who were willing to interact and have fun with me (\[situ\](https://x.com/situ200l), \[cosine\](https://x.com/\_cosine\_x), \[雪谋\](https://x.com/YukiHakarigoto), \[Hakadao\](https://x.com/Hakadaooo), \[qiuqiu\](https://x.com/0xqiuqiuu)). New friends are also welcome to connect with me; I am very open to meeting new people, and we can grab a meal or hang out together.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis year, I gradually started buying some digital equipment I hadn't purchased before.\\n\\n\\u003e What notable items did I buy? What do I plan to buy next?\\n\\n- nuphy air 60 v2: My first time using a low-profile keyboard, and with its size and weight, it has become a great companion for my Mac while traveling.\\n- AirPods 4th generation: My first wireless noise-canceling headphones; I found they play a crucial role in many scenarios during my travels.\\n- PS5: My first gaming console; I will start playing Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2024, and I welcome everyone to recommend games to me.\\n\\nI also want to buy a NAS, but the recommendations are varied, and I'm a bit unsure about which model to choose. Next year, I plan to get a new computer; my current M1 Pro is a bit insufficient, mainly because it only has 16GB of memory.\\n\\n## Emotions\\n\\nThis year was also another year of being single; I welcome everyone to introduce me to potential partners. However, I feel it will be quite difficult for me to find someone because I am short (less than 1.7 meters) and not very good-looking.\\n\\nI used to hope that I wouldn't gradually become distant from previous friends due to a lack of daily interaction, but I am now gradually accepting this fact.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAlright, this is my year-end summary for 2024. For me, 2024 was a year of realizing dreams and the beginning of a new journey. I hope that in the days to come, I can continue to be a free and interesting person, doing what I love while planning for my future.\\n\\nAs you can see, there are no pictures in this summary because I haven't developed the habit of taking photos worth storing. I hope to cultivate the habit of recording life next year, making next year's summary more colorful."\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"2a:T25c4,"\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"## 毕业\\n\\n今年上半年，我终于从待了七年的学校毕业了。这对我来说是个解脱。\\n\\n\\u003e 如何评价研究生的时光对我的意义？\\n\\n一方面来说，我在研究生的阶段变化最大。找到了自己真正喜欢做的事情，形成了自己的人生观。学习前端，参与开源，远程兼职，找工作，几乎每个时间段都留下了值得记录的痕迹。如果你对这些感兴趣，可以阅读这两篇文章。\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/work-one-year\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/24-years\\n\\n另一方面来说，对于很不擅长、不喜欢科研的我，这也是我最容易遇到烦心事的日子。因为学校和导师的事情很难让我产生兴趣，整体环境的氛围又很难和自由扯得上半毛钱关系。到最后，三年的时间换回来的是一篇东拼西凑的论文和降低进入社会难度的通行证。不过还好遇上了一些很好的同学，给我带来了很多的安慰。\\n\\n## 工作\\n\\n毕业之后我在美团工作了两个月。\\n\\n\\u003e 在美团的工作体验如何？\\n\\n老实说，美团的工作整体还是很好的。基本上我每天七八点就可以下班，工作的内容也不会很麻烦，组里的同事和领导人也都很 nice。如果我没有更理想自由的工作，暂时在这里工作也很好。但是这毕竟是一份角色更像一个螺丝钉的工作，只能一直在北京租房的生活也不是我想要的。\\n\\n\\u003e 为什么可以果断地选择离开互联网？\\n\\n在很多人的视角里，毕业初期就辞去一个互联网公司的“稳定“工作，看起来不是一个稳妥的选择，但我却不需要任何考虑就可以做出这个决定。因为我一直以来的理想就是能够获得一份远程开源的工作，做自己喜欢的东西，自由的生活。如我喜欢的一句话所说，Don’t do what you should do, do you want. （这是电视剧 Silicon Valley 中 Russ Hanneman 说的，他人虽然不靠谱，但这话还是很对的）\\n\\n---\\n\\n从九月开始我就加入了 RSS3，三个月后顺利的转正。\\n\\n\\u003e 我是怎么找到这样一份理想自由的工作的？\\n\\n说起来其实很简单，我就是一直做自己喜欢做的事情。\\n\\n- 通过对我很喜欢、一直在用的 xLog 和 RSSHub 相关项目的贡献让我认识了 DIYgod。\\n- 看到 DIYgod 今年开的 Follow 的新坑，发现很符合我心中 RSS 阅读器的样子，就提前混进去了项目。\\n- 在 Follow 项目中的参与让我收到了邀请，可以正式加入一起全职开发。\\n\\n做这些事情的出发点都是我很喜欢，不考虑这些可以给我带来什么。如果我没有获得在 Follow 的全职工作，我还是会在空余时间自己去参与，这是不给我钱我也愿意做的事情。从我的经历来看，其实这样你更容易感受到快乐和充实，获得一个自己喜欢的结局。就和打游戏不去刻意刷任务看攻略追求完美一样。\\n\\n\\u003e 在 RSS3 的工作如何？\\n\\n来到 RSS3 之后，我的感觉就是来到了一个可以至少待 10 年的地方，我目前找不到任何缺点，这是最适合我的工作。\\n\\n- 在 Follow 的工作，没有人给你派任务，都是自己按兴趣驱动找事情干，做的产品也是开源的。\\n- 团队氛围十分友好，感觉可以和团队里的任何成员都成为好朋友。\\n- 完全远程+无固定的工作时间，可以很好的兼顾工作和生活。\\n- 薪资待遇不妥协，我可以不用考虑生活的苟且。（这个最不重要）\\n\\n## 开源\\n\\n今年开启了每月赞助开源的计划，预算为 20 刀每月。\\n\\n\\u003e 我赞助了哪些人？总共花了多少钱？\\n\\n你可以在我的 \[GitHub\](https://github.com/hyoban?tab=sponsoring)、\[open collective\](https://opencollective.com/hyoban)、\[爱发电\](https://afdian.com/a/hyoban) 主页上看到我赞助过哪些人或项目。大部分都是我在用的项目、我阅读的博客的作者。\\n\\n具体赞助的数额如下，总计约 253.35 usd，平均到每个月约 21.11 usd。\\n\\n- GitHub 168.06 usd\\n- open collective 47.58 sgd\\n- 爱发电 270 cny\\n\\n\\u003e 我以什么样的方式来赞助？为什么要每月赞助社区？\\n\\n刚开始我选择按月长期赞助某些人再加上 Anthony Fu 的 \[赞助转发计划\](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding)。但是后来发现这样我的预算涉及到的开源作者很有限，就选择自己手动一次性赞助，每次赞助 5 刀。\\n\\n我每天会用到很多开源作者的项目，但这其中很多人的工作可能被忽视，他们的工作得不到相对应的回报。我觉得这样长期下去是很不利于开源社区的发展的，所以我想为开源社区尽我的一份力。\\n\\n今年我也收到了一些人的赞助，非常感谢 \[cuikaipeng\](https://github.com/cuikaipeng) \[Hakadao\](https://afdian.com/a/Hakadao) \[emiyaaaaa\](https://afdian.com/a/emiyaaaaa) 对我的赞助，我会将这笔钱作为我来年赞助预算的一部分。\\n\\n---\\n\\n今年我成功让自己的一点小项目被别人使用，同时在 Follow 中做出了自己的一点贡献。\\n\\n\\u003e 有哪些项目想要分享一下？\\n\\n- \[tailwindcss-classname-highlight\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwindcss-classname-highlight) 高亮你代码文件中会正确生成到 css 的 classname，今年支持了 tailwind v4 beta。我也抽离出其中的和 tailwind api 交互的部分，发布了 \[tailwind-api-utils\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwind-api-utils)。\\n- \[eslint-config-hyoban\](https://github.com/hyoban/eslint-config-hyoban) 一个自认为还不错的 eslint 预设，主要包含 react 和 ts 相关的插件和规则。如果你在用且有想配置的规则和插件的话，欢迎提 issue 让我来加入。\\n\\n你可以在我的 \[GitHub 主页\](https://github.com/hyoban) 中查看更多的项目。\\n\\n\\u003e 目前主要专注于什么开源项目？\\n\\n因为现在的全职开源工作就是做 Follow，所以大部分的时间都放在了和 Follow 相关的开发上。有时候也会顺着平时开发遇到的需求和问题去给上游提 pr。比如最近做了些和 auth 相关的功能，就给 \[better-auth\](https://better-auth.com) 修了点小 bug，总体上它算是个很好用的 auth 相关的库，各种集成很丰富。\\n\\n## 生活\\n\\n离开了北京之后，我开始了在不同城市旅居的生活，今年去了 青岛、郑州、南京、成都、长沙、深圳、香港、广州、上海。\\n\\n\\u003e 我是如何旅居、如何平衡工作和生活的？\\n\\n今年的整体节奏是每一两周换一个城市，选择的城市多是已经有认识的同学或朋友的地方。我在周一到周五固定在一个城市不动，找一个稳定的地方工作。因为当地有同学，所以很大概率能去蹭一下住的地方。在周末，我做飞机或者火车去到下一个城市，可能会随机逛逛，和朋友一起约个饭。\\n\\n这听起来更像是不停换地方工作。因为我不是个很喜欢到处去打卡游历的人，再加上如果一周的时间被工作和游玩塞满的话，我会没有足够的精力。所以其实下半年的旅居生活是分成两部分，十月的时候正好避开国庆在家休息，然后结束广州之行后也回到了家里休息。\\n\\n明年打算在不同的地方待的时间延长到至少一个月，减少我在旅途上的消耗，也留给我更多的时间去感受这个城市。\\n\\n\\u003e 有什么值得一提的事情吗？\\n\\n借着在 Follow 工作，和团队成员一起录了一期 \[web worker\](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67489d8c0ed328720a0ed3ca)。因为是自己一直喜欢听的节目，所以自己有机会能登上这个节目感觉到兴奋。\\n\\n尽管还没有变成一个很主动、外向的人，但是今年也和一些之前在网上有交流的朋友线下见了面，逐渐克服了无法在陌生环境生存的问题，很感谢愿意和我互动玩耍的朋友们（\[situ\](https://x.com/situ200l) \[cosine\](https://x.com/\_cosine\_x) \[雪谋\](https://x.com/YukiHakarigoto) \[Hakadao\](https://x.com/Hakadaooo) \[qiuqiu\](https://x.com/0xqiuqiuu)）。也欢迎新的朋友来和我交流，我很乐意于认识新的朋友，有机会我们一起约饭玩耍。\\n\\n---\\n\\n今年逐渐开始买一些之前没买过的数码装备\\n\\n\\u003e 买了哪些值得一说的东西？还计划买什么？\\n\\n- nuphy air 60 v2 第一次用矮轴的键盘，加上它的尺寸和重量，变成了我和 Mac 在外旅行的好帮手\\n- AirPods 第四代 第一次用无线降噪耳机，因为旅居发现它能在很多场景发挥关键作用。\\n- ps5 我的第一台游戏主机，我在 2024 才开始玩荒野大镖客 2，欢迎大家给我推荐游戏\\n\\n最近还想买一个 nas，但是推荐的五花八门，有点不知道具体买哪个型号。明年打算换一个新的电脑，现在的 m1pro 有点不够用，主要是内存只有 16g。\\n\\n## 情感\\n\\n今年也是继续单身的一年，欢迎大家帮我介绍对象。不过感觉我找对象会很不容易，因为身高很矮（不到一米七）、长得也不好看。\\n\\n之前自己一直都不太希望和之前的朋友因为日常生活没有交集而逐渐变得疏远，现在逐渐接受这个事实。\\n\\n## 总结\\n\\n好啦，这就是我的 2024 年终总结。2024 对我来说是实现了梦想的一年，也是新旅程的起点。希望在未来的日子里，自己还是可以继续做一个自由有趣的人，继续做自己喜欢的事情，同时为自己的未来的日子做好规划。\\n\\n如你所见，这篇总结中没有一张图片，因为我还没有拍值得存储的照片的习惯，明年希望可以养成记录生活的习惯，让下一年的总结多彩一点。\\n"\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"30:{\\"address\\":\\"\\",\\"mime\_type\\":\\"\\",\\"name\\":\\"cover\\"}\\n2f:\[\\"$30\\"\]\\n32:{\\"trait\_type\\":\\"xlog\_slug\\",\\"value\\":\\"review-2024\\"}\\n33:{\\"trait\_type\\":\\"xlog\_disable\_ai\_summary\\",\\"value\\":true}\\n31:\[\\"$32\\",\\"$33\\"\]\\n34:T2a75,"\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"## Graduation\\n\\nIn the first half of this year, I finally graduated from the school I attended for seven years. This is a relief for me.\\n\\n\\u003e How do I evaluate the significance of my graduate school experience?\\n\\nOn one hand, I changed the most during my graduate phase. I found what I truly enjoy doing and formed my own worldview. I learned front-end development, participated in open source, worked remotely, looked for jobs, and almost every period left behind traces worth recording. If you're interested in these, you can read these two articles.\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/work-one-year\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/24-years\\n\\nOn the other hand, for someone like me who is not good at or fond of research, these were also the days when I encountered the most troubles. The matters related to school and mentors were hard to spark my interest, and the overall environment was difficult to relate to freedom. In the end, three years resulted in a patchwork thesis and a pass that lowered the difficulty of entering society. However, I was fortunate to meet some great classmates who brought me a lot of comfort.\\n\\n## Work\\n\\nAfter graduation, I worked at Meituan for two months.\\n\\n\\u003e How was the work experience at Meituan?\\n\\nTo be honest, the overall work at Meituan was quite good. I could basically leave work around seven or eight every day, and the tasks weren't too complicated. My colleagues and leaders in the team were also very nice. If I didn't have a more ideal and free job, working here temporarily would be fine. But after all, this job felt more like a cog in the machine, and living in rented accommodation in Beijing was not what I wanted.\\n\\n\\u003e Why was I able to decisively choose to leave the internet?\\n\\nFrom many people's perspective, quitting a \\"stable\\" job at an internet company early after graduation doesn't seem like a prudent choice, but I could make this decision without any hesitation. Because my long-held ideal has always been to obtain a remote open-source job, doing what I love and living freely. As a saying I like goes, Don’t do what you should do, do what you want. (This was said by Russ Hanneman in the TV series Silicon Valley; although he is unreliable, this statement is still very true.)\\n\\n---\\n\\nStarting in September, I joined RSS3 and successfully transitioned to a full-time position three months later.\\n\\n\\u003e How did I find such an ideal and free job?\\n\\nIt's actually quite simple; I just kept doing what I loved.\\n\\n- My contributions to xLog and RSSHub, projects I really liked and had been using, led me to meet DIYgod.\\n- I saw the new Follow project that DIYgod started this year, which matched my vision of an RSS reader, so I got involved in the project early.\\n- My participation in the Follow project led to an invitation to officially join the team as a full-time developer.\\n\\nThe starting point for doing these things was that I really enjoyed them, without considering what they could bring me. If I hadn't obtained a full-time job at Follow, I would still participate in my spare time; this is something I would willingly do even without payment. From my experience, this way, you can more easily feel happiness and fulfillment, achieving an outcome you like. It's like playing a game without deliberately grinding tasks or following guides to pursue perfection.\\n\\n\\u003e How is the work at RSS3?\\n\\nAfter joining RSS3, my feeling is that I've come to a place where I can stay for at least 10 years; I currently can't find any drawbacks, and this is the most suitable job for me.\\n\\n- In the Follow project, no one assigns you tasks; you find things to do driven by your interests, and the products are open source.\\n- The team atmosphere is very friendly, and I feel I can become good friends with any member of the team.\\n- Completely remote work with no fixed hours allows for a good balance between work and life.\\n- The salary and benefits are uncompromised, so I don't have to worry about the hardships of living. (This is the least important.)\\n\\n## Open Source\\n\\nThis year, I started a monthly sponsorship plan for open source, with a budget of $20 per month.\\n\\n\\u003e Who did I sponsor? How much did I spend in total?\\n\\nYou can see who or what projects I have sponsored on my \[GitHub\](https://github.com/hyoban?tab=sponsoring), \[open collective\](https://opencollective.com/hyoban), and \[爱发电\](https://afdian.com/a/hyoban) homepage. Most of them are projects I use and authors of blogs I read.\\n\\nThe specific sponsorship amounts are as follows, totaling about $253.35, averaging about $21.11 per month.\\n\\n- GitHub $168.06\\n- open collective 47.58 sgd\\n- 爱发电 270 cny\\n\\n\\u003e How do I sponsor? Why do I sponsor the community monthly?\\n\\nAt first, I chose to sponsor certain people on a monthly basis long-term, along with Anthony Fu's \[sponsorship forwarding plan\](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding). However, I later found that this limited the open-source authors I could support within my budget, so I opted to manually sponsor once at a time, contributing $5 each time.\\n\\nI use many open-source authors' projects daily, but the work of many of these individuals may be overlooked, and their efforts do not receive corresponding rewards. I believe that continuing this way is detrimental to the development of the open-source community, so I want to do my part for it.\\n\\nThis year, I also received some sponsorships from others, and I am very grateful to \[cuikaipeng\](https://github.com/cuikaipeng), \[Hakadao\](https://afdian.com/a/Hakadao), and \[emiyaaaaa\](https://afdian.com/a/emiyaaaaa) for their support; I will consider this money as part of my sponsorship budget for next year.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis year, I successfully got a small project of mine used by others and made some contributions to Follow.\\n\\n\\u003e Are there any projects I want to share?\\n\\n- \[tailwindcss-classname-highlight\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwindcss-classname-highlight) highlights the class names in your code files that will correctly generate to CSS, and this year it supports tailwind v4 beta. I also extracted the part that interacts with the tailwind API and released \[tailwind-api-utils\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwind-api-utils).\\n- \[eslint-config-hyoban\](https://github.com/hyoban/eslint-config-hyoban) is an ESLint preset that I think is quite good, mainly containing plugins and rules related to React and TypeScript. If you're using it and have rules or plugins you'd like to configure, feel free to open an issue for me to add them.\\n\\nYou can find more projects on my \[GitHub homepage\](https://github.com/hyoban).\\n\\n\\u003e What open-source projects am I currently focusing on?\\n\\nSince my full-time open-source job is working on Follow, most of my time is spent on development related to Follow. Sometimes I also submit PRs to upstream projects based on needs and issues encountered during development. For example, I recently worked on some auth-related features and fixed a few bugs in \[better-auth\](https://better-auth.com); overall, it is a very useful auth-related library with rich integrations.\\n\\n## Life\\n\\nAfter leaving Beijing, I started a life of traveling in different cities. This year, I went to Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Changsha, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.\\n\\n\\u003e How do I travel and balance work and life?\\n\\nThe overall rhythm this year is to change cities every week or two, mostly choosing places where I have classmates or friends. I stay fixed in one city from Monday to Friday, finding a stable place to work. Since I have classmates in the area, I can often crash at their place. On weekends, I take a flight or train to the next city, possibly wandering around randomly or meeting friends for a meal.\\n\\nThis sounds more like constantly changing places to work. I’m not someone who enjoys checking in at tourist spots, and if my week is filled with work and play, I won't have enough energy. So, the traveling life in the second half of the year was divided into two parts: in October, I stayed home to avoid the National Day rush, and after finishing my trip to Guangzhou, I returned home to rest.\\n\\nNext year, I plan to extend my stay in different places to at least a month, reducing my travel fatigue and giving me more time to experience each city.\\n\\n\\u003e Is there anything worth mentioning?\\n\\nThanks to working at Follow, I recorded an episode of \[web worker\](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67489d8c0ed328720a0ed3ca) with team members. Since it’s a show I’ve always enjoyed listening to, I felt excited to have the opportunity to appear on it.\\n\\nAlthough I haven't become a very proactive or outgoing person yet, this year I also met some friends I had previously interacted with online, gradually overcoming the issue of not being able to thrive in unfamiliar environments. I am very grateful to the friends who were willing to interact and have fun with me (\[situ\](https://x.com/situ200l), \[cosine\](https://x.com/\_cosine\_x), \[雪谋\](https://x.com/YukiHakarigoto), \[Hakadao\](https://x.com/Hakadaooo), \[qiuqiu\](https://x.com/0xqiuqiuu)). New friends are also welcome to connect with me; I am very open to meeting new people, and we can grab a meal or hang out together.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis year, I gradually started buying some digital equipment I hadn't purchased before.\\n\\n\\u003e What notable items did I buy? What do I plan to buy next?\\n\\n- nuphy air 60 v2: My first time using a low-profile keyboard, and with its size and weight, it has become a great companion for my Mac while traveling.\\n- AirPods 4th generation: My first wireless noise-canceling headphones; I found they play a crucial role in many scenarios during my travels.\\n- PS5: My first gaming console; I will start playing Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2024, and I welcome everyone to recommend games to me.\\n\\nI also want to buy a NAS, but the recommendations are varied, and I'm a bit unsure about which model to choose. Next year, I plan to get a new computer; my current M1 Pro is a bit insufficient, mainly because it only has 16GB of memory.\\n\\n## Emotions\\n\\nThis year was also another year of being single; I welcome everyone to introduce me to potential partners. However, I feel it will be quite difficult for me to find someone because I am short (less than 1.7 meters) and not very good-looking.\\n\\nI used to hope that I wouldn't gradually become distant from previous friends due to a lack of daily interaction, but I am now gradually accepting this fact.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAlright, this is my year-end summary for 2024. For me, 2024 was a year of realizing dreams and the beginning of a new journey. I hope that in the days to come, I can continue to be a free and interesting person, doing what I love while planning for my future.\\n\\nAs you can see, there are no pictures in this summary because I haven't developed the habit of taking photos worth storing. I hope to cultivate the habit of recording life next year, making next year's summary more colorful."\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"35:\[\\"xlog\\"\]\\n36:\[\\"post\\",\\"Review\\"\]\\n37:\[\]\\n2e:{\\"attachments\\":\\"$2f\\",\\"attributes\\":\\"$31\\",\\"content\\":\\"$34\\",\\"date\_published\\":\\"2025-01-01T03:12:15.412Z\\",\\"sources\\":\\"$35\\",\\"summary\\":\\"实现梦想的一年，希望未来自己能持续进步。\\",\\"tags\\":\\"$36\\",\\"title\\":\\"2024

毕业\\n\\n今年上半年，我终于从待了七年的学校毕业了。这对我来说是个解脱。\\n\\n\\u003e 如何评价研究生的时光对我的意义？\\n\\n一方面来说，我在研究生的阶段变化最大。找到了自己真正喜欢做的事情，形成了自己的人生观。学习前端，参与开源，远程兼职，找工作，几乎每个时间段都留下了值得记录的痕迹。如果你对这些感兴趣，可以阅读这两篇文章。\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/work-one-year\\n\\nhttps://hyoban.xlog.app/24-years\\n\\n另一方面来说，对于很不擅长、不喜欢科研的我，这也是我最容易遇到烦心事的日子。因为学校和导师的事情很难让我产生兴趣，整体环境的氛围又很难和自由扯得上半毛钱关系。到最后，三年的时间换回来的是一篇东拼西凑的论文和降低进入社会难度的通行证。不过还好遇上了一些很好的同学，给我带来了很多的安慰。\\n\\n## 工作\\n\\n毕业之后我在美团工作了两个月。\\n\\n\\u003e 在美团的工作体验如何？\\n\\n老实说，美团的工作整体还是很好的。基本上我每天七八点就可以下班，工作的内容也不会很麻烦，组里的同事和领导人也都很 nice。如果我没有更理想自由的工作，暂时在这里工作也很好。但是这毕竟是一份角色更像一个螺丝钉的工作，只能一直在北京租房的生活也不是我想要的。\\n\\n\\u003e 为什么可以果断地选择离开互联网？\\n\\n在很多人的视角里，毕业初期就辞去一个互联网公司的“稳定“工作，看起来不是一个稳妥的选择，但我却不需要任何考虑就可以做出这个决定。因为我一直以来的理想就是能够获得一份远程开源的工作，做自己喜欢的东西，自由的生活。如我喜欢的一句话所说，Don’t do what you should do, do you want. （这是电视剧 Silicon Valley 中 Russ Hanneman 说的，他人虽然不靠谱，但这话还是很对的）\\n\\n---\\n\\n从九月开始我就加入了 RSS3，三个月后顺利的转正。\\n\\n\\u003e 我是怎么找到这样一份理想自由的工作的？\\n\\n说起来其实很简单，我就是一直做自己喜欢做的事情。\\n\\n- 通过对我很喜欢、一直在用的 xLog 和 RSSHub 相关项目的贡献让我认识了 DIYgod。\\n- 看到 DIYgod 今年开的 Follow 的新坑，发现很符合我心中 RSS 阅读器的样子，就提前混进去了项目。\\n- 在 Follow 项目中的参与让我收到了邀请，可以正式加入一起全职开发。\\n\\n做这些事情的出发点都是我很喜欢，不考虑这些可以给我带来什么。如果我没有获得在 Follow 的全职工作，我还是会在空余时间自己去参与，这是不给我钱我也愿意做的事情。从我的经历来看，其实这样你更容易感受到快乐和充实，获得一个自己喜欢的结局。就和打游戏不去刻意刷任务看攻略追求完美一样。\\n\\n\\u003e 在 RSS3 的工作如何？\\n\\n来到 RSS3 之后，我的感觉就是来到了一个可以至少待 10 年的地方，我目前找不到任何缺点，这是最适合我的工作。\\n\\n- 在 Follow 的工作，没有人给你派任务，都是自己按兴趣驱动找事情干，做的产品也是开源的。\\n- 团队氛围十分友好，感觉可以和团队里的任何成员都成为好朋友。\\n- 完全远程+无固定的工作时间，可以很好的兼顾工作和生活。\\n- 薪资待遇不妥协，我可以不用考虑生活的苟且。（这个最不重要）\\n\\n## 开源\\n\\n今年开启了每月赞助开源的计划，预算为 20 刀每月。\\n\\n\\u003e 我赞助了哪些人？总共花了多少钱？\\n\\n你可以在我的 \[GitHub\](https://github.com/hyoban?tab=sponsoring)、\[open collective\](https://opencollective.com/hyoban)、\[爱发电\](https://afdian.com/a/hyoban) 主页上看到我赞助过哪些人或项目。大部分都是我在用的项目、我阅读的博客的作者。\\n\\n具体赞助的数额如下，总计约 253.35 usd，平均到每个月约 21.11 usd。\\n\\n- GitHub 168.06 usd\\n- open collective 47.58 sgd\\n- 爱发电 270 cny\\n\\n\\u003e 我以什么样的方式来赞助？为什么要每月赞助社区？\\n\\n刚开始我选择按月长期赞助某些人再加上 Anthony Fu 的 \[赞助转发计划\](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding)。但是后来发现这样我的预算涉及到的开源作者很有限，就选择自己手动一次性赞助，每次赞助 5 刀。\\n\\n我每天会用到很多开源作者的项目，但这其中很多人的工作可能被忽视，他们的工作得不到相对应的回报。我觉得这样长期下去是很不利于开源社区的发展的，所以我想为开源社区尽我的一份力。\\n\\n今年我也收到了一些人的赞助，非常感谢 \[cuikaipeng\](https://github.com/cuikaipeng) \[Hakadao\](https://afdian.com/a/Hakadao) \[emiyaaaaa\](https://afdian.com/a/emiyaaaaa) 对我的赞助，我会将这笔钱作为我来年赞助预算的一部分。\\n\\n---\\n\\n今年我成功让自己的一点小项目被别人使用，同时在 Follow 中做出了自己的一点贡献。\\n\\n\\u003e 有哪些项目想要分享一下？\\n\\n- \[tailwindcss-classname-highlight\](https://github.com/hyoban/tailwindcss-classname-highlight) 高亮你代码文件中会正确生成到 css 的 classname，今年支持了 tailwind v4 beta。我也抽离出其中的和 tailwind api

相关的插件和规则。如果你在用且有想配置的规则和插件的话，欢迎提 issue 让我来加入。\\n\\n你可以在我的 \[GitHub 主页\](https://github.com/hyoban) 中查看更多的项目。\\n\\n\\u003e 目前主要专注于什么开源项目？\\n\\n因为现在的全职开源工作就是做 Follow，所以大部分的时间都放在了和 Follow 相关的开发上。有时候也会顺着平时开发遇到的需求和问题去给上游提 pr。比如最近做了些和 auth 相关的功能，就给 \[better-auth\](https://better-auth.com) 修了点小 bug，总体上它算是个很好用的 auth 相关的库，各种集成很丰富。\\n\\n## 生活\\n\\n离开了北京之后，我开始了在不同城市旅居的生活，今年去了 青岛、郑州、南京、成都、长沙、深圳、香港、广州、上海。\\n\\n\\u003e 我是如何旅居、如何平衡工作和生活的？\\n\\n今年的整体节奏是每一两周换一个城市，选择的城市多是已经有认识的同学或朋友的地方。我在周一到周五固定在一个城市不动，找一个稳定的地方工作。因为当地有同学，所以很大概率能去蹭一下住的地方。在周末，我做飞机或者火车去到下一个城市，可能会随机逛逛，和朋友一起约个饭。\\n\\n这听起来更像是不停换地方工作。因为我不是个很喜欢到处去打卡游历的人，再加上如果一周的时间被工作和游玩塞满的话，我会没有足够的精力。所以其实下半年的旅居生活是分成两部分，十月的时候正好避开国庆在家休息，然后结束广州之行后也回到了家里休息。\\n\\n明年打算在不同的地方待的时间延长到至少一个月，减少我在旅途上的消耗，也留给我更多的时间去感受这个城市。\\n\\n\\u003e 有什么值得一提的事情吗？\\n\\n借着在 Follow 工作，和团队成员一起录了一期 \[web worker\](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67489d8c0ed328720a0ed3ca)。因为是自己一直喜欢听的节目，所以自己有机会能登上这个节目感觉到兴奋。\\n\\n尽管还没有变成一个很主动、外向的人，但是今年也和一些之前在网上有交流的朋友线下见了面，逐渐克服了无法在陌生环境生存的问题，很感谢愿意和我互动玩耍的朋友们（\[situ\](https://x.com/situ200l) \[cosine\](https://x.com/\_cosine\_x) \[雪谋\](https://x.com/YukiHakarigoto) \[Hakadao\](https://x.com/Hakadaooo) \[qiuqiu\](https://x.com/0xqiuqiuu)）。也欢迎新的朋友来和我交流，我很乐意于认识新的朋友，有机会我们一起约饭玩耍。\\n\\n---\\n\\n今年逐渐开始买一些之前没买过的数码装备\\n\\n\\u003e 买了哪些值得一说的东西？还计划买什么？\\n\\n- nuphy air 60 v2 第一次用矮轴的键盘，加上它的尺寸和重量，变成了我和 Mac 在外旅行的好帮手\\n- AirPods 第四代 第一次用无线降噪耳机，因为旅居发现它能在很多场景发挥关键作用。\\n- ps5 我的第一台游戏主机，我在 2024 才开始玩荒野大镖客 2，欢迎大家给我推荐游戏\\n\\n最近还想买一个 nas，但是推荐的五花八门，有点不知道具体买哪个型号。明年打算换一个新的电脑，现在的 m1pro 有点不够用，主要是内存只有 16g。\\n\\n## 情感\\n\\n今年也是继续单身的一年，欢迎大家帮我介绍对象。不过感觉我找对象会很不容易，因为身高很矮（不到一米七）、长得也不好看。\\n\\n之前自己一直都不太希望和之前的朋友因为日常生活没有交集而逐渐变得疏远，现在逐渐接受这个事实。\\n\\n## 总结\\n\\n好啦，这就是我的 2024 年终总结。2024 对我来说是实现了梦想的一年，也是新旅程的起点。希望在未来的日子里，自己还是可以继续做一个自由有趣的人，继续做自己喜欢的事情，同时为自己的未来的日子做好规划。\\n\\n如你所见，这篇总结中没有一张图片，因为我还没有拍值得存储的照片的习惯，明年希望可以养成记录生活的习惯，让下一年的总结多彩一点。\\n"\])self.\_\_next\_f.push(\[1,"6c:\[\\"xlog\\"\]\\n6d:\[\\"post\\",\\"Review\\"\]\\n6e:\[\]\\n65:{\\"attachments\\":\\"$66\\",\\"attributes\\":\\"$68\\",\\"content\\":\\"$6b\\",\\"date\_published\\":\\"2025-01-01T03:12:15.412Z\\",\\"sources\\":\\"$6c\\",\\"summary\\":\\"实现梦想的一年，希望未来自己能持续进步。\\",\\"tags\\":\\"$6d\\",\\"title\\":\\"2024
